# FIRST VERSION (by myself)
# When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently. 
# There is a list of 26 character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index 0 and 'z' is at index 25. There will also be a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mmË†2 assuming all letters are 1mm wide.
# example:
# h = 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5] word - torn
# The heights are t = 2, o = 1, = 1 and n = 1. The tallest letter is 2 high and there are 4 letters. The highlighted area will be 2 * 4 = 8mm? so
# the answer is 8.

# time = O(n) --> because of the sorting method
# space = O(n) --> where n is the word size
