# Algorithm and Data Structure Practice
This repository serves as a collection of coding problems and solutions related to algorithms and data structures, aimed at improving my skills for technical interviews.

## What's Included:
- A variety of problems categorized by data structures and algorithms (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Heap, Sorting, Searching, etc.).
- Clear and concise solutions written in Python and Javascript.
- Comments and explanations within the code to enhance understanding.
- Screenshot from Excalidraw where I used the tool to visualize the solution better.
- Test cases (print statements) for some problems to verify the correctness of the solutions

## Learning Resources:
During the summer of 2024, I attended the [CodePath Technical Interview Preparation - Intermediate](https://www.codepath.org/courses). The course helped me to focus on the learning journey.
