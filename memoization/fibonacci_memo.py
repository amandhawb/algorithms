# The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
# F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
# F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
# Given n, calculate F(n).

# time: O(n)
# space: O(n)
