# 1) What traversal of binary search tree produces elements in sorted order?
# Answer: In-order traversal

# 2) You have the following tree: 
    #       8
    #     /   \
    #    5      4
    #   / \      \
    #  9   7      11
    #     / \     /
    #    1   12   3
    #        /
    #        2

# After traversing it using post order traversal and print the data for each node, what will be the output?
# Answer: 9, 1, 2, 12, 7, 5, 3, 11, 4, 8

# 3) Given a binary search tree where all the left nodes are NULL, what is the time complexity to search the tree to see for a given target value?
# Answer: O(N)

# 4) We are asked for pre order traversal of a binary tree without using recursion. Which one of these data structures would you most likely use?
# a) stack b) queue c) heap d) none of above
# Answer: Stack

# 5) Which of the following trees is not a valid BST? (choose all that apply)
# a)                                    
    #       5
    #     /   \
    #    2      7
    #   / \     
    #  1   6  
    
# b)
    #       5
    #     /   \
    #    2      7
    #   /     
    #  1   

# c)
    #       5
    #     /   \
    #    2      7
    #   /    
    #  6         
   
# d)
    #       5
    #     /   \
    #    2     7
    #   /      /
    #  1       6 

# Answer: a and c
